# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we employ the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction. The goal is to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant based on the provided dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Algorithms Used**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Dataset**: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Objective**: To build a predictive model that accurately classifies tumors as benign or malignant.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Reduction**: Using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance.
- **Model Training**: Training the KNN algorithm on the processed dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, you will obtain various performance metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
